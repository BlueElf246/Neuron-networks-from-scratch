# Neuron-networks-from-scratch
Hello welcome to my min-project on implementing deep learning architectures(ANN, CNN, RNN) from scratch. I also provide sample dataset to test out these models.

It is also have the comparation part. Where I will write some codes to compare accuracy with different hyperparameters choice.

Untill now, I have implemented a set of functions for making neuron networks. You can see all of it in nn_lib_v2.

Features in nn_lib_v2.
-> binary_classfication with last layer is sigmoid
-> multiclass classification with last layer is softmax
-> 'he' initilization

There are two application that use this lib named binary_classification.py and multiclass_classfication.py, where you have to download mnist dataset by yourself

The code is partly borrowed from propramming exercise in course 1 in the serie of deep learning course taught by Andrew Ng.

If you do not understanding anything. You are welcome to ask me vie my gmail: lemanhdat2112@gmail.com
Thank you, ðŸ˜Š
